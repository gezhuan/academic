Fluid-granular mixture flows play a crucial role in various natural and engineering systems, ranging from cell clusters to debris flows, landslides, and particulate flows in the chemical engineering and food processing. However, complex particle-particle interactions and fluid effects poses significant challenges in understanding the yielding, jamming transition, and rheology of granular assemblies, necessitating the development of comprehensive and specific governing laws.

During my doctoral studies, I have focused on the unifying rheology of fluid-granular mixtures and have gained substantial experience in numerical modeling (from micro scale to macro scale), theoretical analysis, and experimental design. My research has involved: (1) we proposed a length-scale based dimensionless number, which can unifying the solid fraction and the apparent frictional coefficient of the fluid-granular mixtures. (2) We proposed the expression of the stress of fluid-granular mixture under random force field, and give the specific contributions of each force field. (3) We use the proposed dimensionless number to unify the yielding, jamming transition, and rheology of transient submerged granular avalanche. The detailed information are included in the attachment.
