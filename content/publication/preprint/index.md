abstract: In this communication, we present a new lengthscale-based rheology for dense sheared particle suspensions as they transition from inertial- to viscous-dominated.  We derive a lengthscale ratio using physics-based considerations for a particle subjected to pressure and drag.  In doing so, we demonstrate that an appropriately derived length-scale ratio provides a consistent relationship between normal stress and system proximity to its ''jammed'' or solid-like state, even as a system transitions between inertial and viscous states, intrinsically captured by a variable Stokes number.

summary: We proposed a new dimensionless number based on length scale ratio G, which unified the rheology of fluid-solid mixture under different confining pressure, shear rate, fluid, and solid properties for both our simulation data and other published experimental data in a steady state.The new dimensionless number can naturally transform into the pioneersâ€™ works with the changing of the Stokes number (the number measured the effect of fluid and inertial), such as the inertial number when fluid put no effect and viscous number when fluid effect is dominate.
